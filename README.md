# Monty Python

## Description
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

```
push 0
push 1
push 2
  push 3
                   pall    
push 4
    push 5    
      push    6        
pall
```
Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account.

## Installation
First, clone this repository onto your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/ethanpasta/monty.git
```
After `cd`ing into the directory, compile all files with:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```
You should now have a `monty` executable file.

## Usage
`./monty file` where `file` is the path to the file containing Monty byte code

The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stops if either:
 - It executed properly every line of the file
 - It finds an error in the file
 - An error occured
